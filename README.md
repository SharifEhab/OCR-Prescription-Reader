## Key Features

1. **Image Preprocessing**:
   - Noise reduction, adaptive thresholding, and morphological operations for improved OCR accuracy.
2. **Text Extraction**:
   - Utilizes Tesseract OCR to extract text from prescription images.
3. **AI Integration**:
   - Validates and refines extracted text using the **Gemini AI Model**, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
4. **Drug Interaction Check**:
   - RxNorm
5. **PDF Output**:
   - Generates a structured PDF report with extracted and validated data.

## System Workflow

### 1. Image Preprocessing
- **Steps**:
  1. Convert image to grayscale for simplicity.
  2. Apply denoising using Non-Local Means filtering.
  3. Perform adaptive thresholding to binarize the image.
  4. Invert the binary image and apply dilation for contour detection.
- **Purpose**: Enhances text clarity and prepares the image for OCR.

### 2. Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- Uses Tesseract OCR to detect and extract text regions from preprocessed images.
- Bounding boxes are generated for potential text areas, which are cropped, resized, and analyzed.

### 3. AI Validation
- Extracted text is passed to the Gemini AI Model for validation and correction.
- **Gemini Enhancements**:
  - Corrects abbreviations and errors in medication names.
  - Standardizes dosage units and frequencies (e.g., "QD" â†’ "once daily").
  - Structures the data into a clear and consistent format.

### 4. Output Generation
- Results are saved as:
  - A **JSON file** for programmatic use.
  - A **PDF report** for easy sharing and documentation.

---

## Example Workflow

1. **Image Input**:
   - Upload a prescription image via the web interface.
2. **Processing**:
   - Preprocess the image and extract text using Tesseract OCR.
3. **Validation**:
   - AI validates and structures the extracted text.
4. **Output**:
   - View structured text and download the PDF report.

## Limitations

1. **Handwritten Text**:
   - Tesseract OCR struggles with highly variable handwriting.
   - Designed primarily for printed prescriptions.
2. **Image Quality**:
   - Poor-quality or low-resolution images may impact accuracy.

---

## Future Directions

1. **Enhanced Models**:
   - Replace Tesseract with advanced deep learning-based OCR models like CRNN or Vision Transformers for better handwriting recognition.
2. **Edge Deployment**:
   - Optimize for mobile and IoT devices for on-the-go prescription analysis.
3. **Multilingual Support**:
   - Extend support to non-English prescriptions and international drug standards.
